I am learning cybersecurity because I am passionate about protecting digital systems and data from ever-evolving threats. In a world where cyberattacks are increasing, I want to understand vulnerabilities, strengthen security defenses, and contribute to a safer digital environment. Ethical hacking, risk management, and network security fascinate me, and I see cybersecurity as a field where I can make a real impact. My goal is to develop the skills needed to prevent cyber threats and help organizations stay secure in an increasingly connected world.
